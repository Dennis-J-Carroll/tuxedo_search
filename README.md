# Tuxedo Search Engine Project  
[##Tuxedo is a high-performance hybrid search engine]

## Project Overview
Tuxedo is a high-performance hybrid search engine designed for instantaneous information retrieval, with a target response time of ≤0.405 seconds. It combines Python's flexibility with C's performance and assembly optimizations to achieve ultra-fast search capabilities.

## Key Technical Features
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Python for high-level operations, C for core functionality, and Assembly for critical path optimizations
- **SIMD Acceleration**: Utilizes AVX-512 instructions for parallel pattern matching and string operations
- **Multi-Level Caching**: Progressive response system with L1/L2/Redis caching layers
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Enhanced fuzzy search capabilities using optimized algorithms
- **Memory Management**: NUMA-aware memory operations with specialized pools for different allocation sizes

## Core Components
1. **Query Processor**
   - Progressive response generation
   - Intelligent query routing
   - Real-time result ranking

2. **Pattern Matcher**
   - SIMD-optimized string matching
   - Approximate matching with Assembly acceleration
   - Parallel pattern processing

3. **Cache System**
   - Sub-millisecond L1 cache
   - Distributed L2 cache with Redis
   - Predictive cache warming

4. **Result Optimizer**
   - Real-time result ranking
   - Context-aware scoring
   - Parallel result merging

## Performance Targets
- Initial response: ≤0.405 seconds
